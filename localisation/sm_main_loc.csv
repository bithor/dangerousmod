EVTOPTAsoulmates.5221;My beautiful gold coins...gone forever...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsoulmates.5222;Your [Root.Spouse.GetHusbandWife] had gone to the market today with a large pouch of gold. After a day of trading and bartering goods, [Root.GetSheHe] has returned to the castle with a pouch slightly heavier than it was at the start of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

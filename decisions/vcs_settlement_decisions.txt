#	owned: all settlements owned by the AI
#	vassal_owned: all settlements owned by direct vassal rulers of the AI's employer
#	sub_realm_owned: all settlements below the AI's employer
#	realm_owned: all settlements in the same top realm as the AI
#	dynasty_owned: all settlements owned by members of the same dynasty
